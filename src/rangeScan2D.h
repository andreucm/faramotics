/**
* \brief CrangeScan2D class
* 
* This class implements a 2D ranging devices with an aperture that can be greater than PI. 
* From an initial set of device parameters, the class determines the number of sectors
* and the parameters of each one. The full scan is computed as the concatenation of each partial scan from each sector.
* The function loadModel() allows to load the 3D model used to compute range scans.
* The function computeScan() implements the full computation of the entire range scan of the device being simulated.
* So, the required input parameters that describe a 2D range device are:
*	- numPoints: number of range points [#]
*	- aperture: horizontal aperture [rad]
*	- angularAccuracy: angular accuracy of the rays [rad]
*	- rangeMin: minimum range [m]
*	- rangeMax: maximum range [m]
* It is also required to specify a 3D model, either as a .obj file or as an ID.
